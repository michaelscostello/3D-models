This slide mount was designed for the Olympus IX71 fluorescent scope. 
The original slide mount caused problems viewing Immunoflorescent slides prepared with 8 samples.
The original slide mount crashed into the 60X objective, causing samples to be out of focus on the perimeter.
The mount here has excess material removed so that the oil objective is not impeded in movement.
